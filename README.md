## Selected Projects

### Project Nexus — AI-Powered Campus Platform
Final Year Design Project. A unified university management ecosystem built on polyglot microservices that eliminates data silos between Student Information Systems and Learning Management Systems. Implements a hybrid CAG + RAG chatbot via LangChain and Google Gemini, multi-factor biometric attendance with CV-based spoof detection, and predictive at-risk student analytics. Event-driven communication through Apache Kafka ensures zero data loss across services.

### EtapsAI — Intelligent E-Commerce Chatbot
Production-oriented chatbot platform built during an internship at Tracking Pakistan. Classifies user intent across five categories (general, order tracking, product info, purchase, category browsing) and generates contextual responses backed by a dual-database architecture — MySQL for structured product and order data, MongoDB for persistent chat history. Integrates OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for natural language understanding.

### NL-to-SQL Database Assistant
An end-to-end pipeline that translates natural language queries into validated SQL against a production e-commerce schema. Includes a query refinement loop (up to 3 iterations) driven by Gemini, semantic synonym mapping for product terms, automatic query enhancement for inventory joins, and a Streamlit-based chat interface with structured result formatting.

### AI Linux Server Health Analyzer
A read-only system auditing tool that collects CPU, memory, and disk metrics via Bash, analyzes authentication and system logs for anomalies, and surfaces AI-generated recommendations through Gemini, OpenAI, or Anthropic — selected via environment configuration. Uses rule-based severity thresholds as a fallback when the LLM is unavailable.

### PALESSI — E-Commerce Platform
Full-featured Django e-commerce application with session-based cart, multi-step checkout with auto-generated order numbers, role-based admin panel, and sale-price handling. Demonstrates clean separation between store and cart apps with context processors for global state.
